This is an implementation of Connect Four on an Arduino.

# The Plan
1. Figure out how to implement connect four using C++
2. Do that on an Arduino
3. Make it intelligent (and take over the world some day)

# Goals for first protoype
- Two player mode
- Players selecting which row to drop token in
- Game board updating
